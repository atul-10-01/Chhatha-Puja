            <h1>HISTORY OF CHHATHA</h1>
            <hr><br><br>
           <p> Chhatha has been mentioned in both the major Indian epics. <br><br><br> In Ramayan, when Ram and Sita returned Ayodhya, people celebrated Deepawali, and on its sixth day Ramrajya (Kingdom of Ram) was established. On this day Ram and Sita kept fast and Surya Shashthi/Chhatha Puja was performed by Sita. Hence, she was blessed with Lava and Kush as their sons.
            <br><br><br>
                        While in the Mahabharat, Chhatha Puja was performed by Kunti after they escaped from Lakshagriha. It is also believed that Karn, the son of Surya and Kunti, was conceived after Kunti performed Chhatha puja. Draupadi is also said to perform the Puja for Pandavas to win the Kurukshetra War. It is believed that Draupadi performed Chhatah Puja near a spring in Nagdi village of Ranchi. In this village Chhatha vratis neither offers Arghya in the river nor in the pond. Chhatha Puja is performed near that spring in Nagdi.</p>
